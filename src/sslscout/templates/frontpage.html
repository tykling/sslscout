                        <p>The complexity of configuring an ssl webserver correctly has lead to the creation of different online ssl configuration checking websites that help administrators get it the configuration right.</p>
                        <p>The problem with this approach is that few administrators remember to re-check their configuration periodically. While best practices concerning SSL configuration change all the time, the actual configuration of websites is often static for years.</p>
                        <p>With sslscout administrators can configure automatic periodic checks of their websites with the different ssl-configuration checking services, and get email notifications when the site rating changes.</p>
